# EsenChat
Create group chats with friends and family to stay in touch, and share your current location so they always know where you are. EsenChat also allows you to make voice or video calls, so you can have face-to-face conversations no matter where you are in the world.

At EsenChat, your privacy is our top priority. That's why we use end-to-end encryption to ensure that all your conversations are safe and secure. Only you and the people you're chatting with can see your messages, photos, and videos.

Customize your chats with unique backgrounds, emojis, and stickers, and express yourself in fun and creative ways. EsenChat also allows you to mark important messages as "favorites," so you can easily find them later.

Whether you're looking to stay in touch with family and friends, or simply want a reliable and secure messaging app, EsenChat has everything you need. Download EsenChat today from the Google Play Store and start chatting with your loved ones in a snap!
